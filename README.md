# Jump_Height_Prediction

## Project Overview:

* Using data from the teams of the Volleyball Nations League
* Performing a simple linear regression
* Creating a simple Webapp with Flask


## Introduction:

In the following project, I gathered few data from professional Volleyballplayers. Based on their age, height and weight a build a simple regression model. The question I asked myself was: Can I predict the spike height and block height of a player based on this variables?
But the maintask for me was to (finally!) deploy a model on a webapp. Therefore I used Flask and the resources listed below.



## Further Steps:  

Adding more data would be benefitial for the accuracy of the prediction. Additionally one can think about finetuning the visual appearance of this simple Web-Application.
